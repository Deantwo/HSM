Hazeron Ship Museum for use with .ship files (and for use with SODS, by Ikkir aka Moghjubar aka @Ikkir_Isth aka KRb, not officially associated with Shores of Hazeron)

This is a program I made to learn GL 3.3 aka slightly more modern openGL, and some shader stuff, presented AS IS.
Featured loading in and displaying .ship files in 3d, with various test geometry to display possible room configurations in a proof-of-concept for ship redesigns.
Also featured exporting ships to .obj files and writing captured images to an FBO and exporting to .png


Requirements: SDL (pretty sure this one was SDL 2.0), SDL_image, GL, glm, zlib (for png stuff) and libpng, glew
